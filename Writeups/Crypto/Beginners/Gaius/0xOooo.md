## Write-up:

In this challenge a quick google search reveals the meaning of gaius as "*Gaius Caesar (/ˈsiːzər/; 20 BC – 21 February AD 4) was consul in AD 1 and the grandson of Augustus, the first emperor of the Roman Empire.*"

looked like a caesar cipher and quickly using https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher the following we decode the flag as sh1ft_c1ph3r_n4m3d_4ft3r_jul1us_c43s4r

including the flag inside our flag format we get hacktoberfest_ctf{sh1ft_c1ph3r_n4m3d_4ft3r_jul1us_c43s4r} as our flag
