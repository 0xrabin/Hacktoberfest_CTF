## Challenge Flag: hacktoberfest_ctf{V1SU41_CRYPTO_W1TH_BR41LL3}

## Write-up:

> Here an image was given with description as ü§®Are you blind?? ü§®

Include your flag inside the flag format; i.e. hacktoberfest_ctf{FLAG}! 

so since this looked like a ciphertext and i had done similar challange in nickctf

so hovering over the image and a quick inspect element gives us the title as `‚†ß‚†Ç‚†é‚†•‚†≤‚†Ç‚†∏‚†â‚†ó‚†Ω‚†è‚†û‚†ï‚†∏‚†∫‚†Ç‚†û‚†ì‚†∏‚†É‚†ó‚†≤‚†Ç‚†á‚†á‚†í`

so this was using braille cipher which is for blind people using cyber chef and quickly decoding the cipher from braille we get the flag as v1su41_crypto_w1th_br41ll3 so including this inside our flag format we get hacktober_ctf{v1su41_crypto_w1th_br41ll3}
