here the challange description said One of our challenge authors shared the post from our event page on Facebook just 12 hours before his presentation. Can you exfiltrate the flag from what he shared? so viewing facebook profiles of mahesh nikhil and binit i found binit sharing the post Make sure not to miss the session in 12 hours from now viewing its edit history we get the flag as hacktoberfest_ctf{h0w_4b0u7_sh4r3d_p0s7_3d17_h1st0ry}
