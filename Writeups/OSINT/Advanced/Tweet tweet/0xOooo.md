## Write-up:

here the challange is created by captain nick lucipher since we get link to his twitter lin the challenge description https://twitter.com/naryal2580/ viewing the latest tweet from him i saw a link to 000webhost site and stumbled upon it for long time and decided to check the wayback machine so i loaded the website in wayback machine and saw last saved as october 7 and seeing the page and lol we get an image with THERE ARE NO FLAGS here so viewing the source of the page at bottom we see html comments with filename.mp4 looked like this was giving some direction towards flag again i stumbled upon this for couple of minutes and just entering the path as flag.mp4 i got a music video == > https://web.archive.org/web/20201007093142/https://w38-ho0k.000webhostapp.com/flag.mp4 and having a closer look at the video for 3 or 4 times i figured out a weird white text in one of the frame halfway near the ending which wasnt visible so i saved the screenshot of that frame and loaded the image in photo editor then lowered the brightness and made the image more sharper and saw flag as hacktoberfest_ctf{rickrolled_for_the_flag}
